### ðŸŽ¨ Static Home Page Project
Welcome to my first-ever web development project! ðŸš€ This is a static home page built using HTML and CSS, inspired by a WordPress design. Itâ€™s not responsive and could use some polishing, but Iâ€™m proud of it as my first solo project. ðŸ’ª

Check it out live here: [Static Home Page on GitHub Pages](https://magdamie.github.io/staticWebsite/) â€” but only if youâ€™re on a laptop! Itâ€™s not quite ready to charm your phone or your giant screen yet. ðŸ˜…


## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- HTML and CSS Fundamentals: Understanding layout structure and basic styling.
- Positioning & Alignment: Getting elements to behave (most of the timeðŸ˜‰).
- Debugging: Solving issues with a mix of trial, error, and persistence.
- Self-Learning: Tackling a full project independently for the first time.
## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- HTML: For the structure.
- CSS: For the styling.
## ðŸ”§ Known Issues & Limitations
- Responsiveness: Not optimized for mobile or smaller screens.
- Code Quality: Could be refactored, but it serves as a great learning milestone.
